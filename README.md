# Switch-Btw-OpenWindows-Macro
This project was made so you can be able to switch between diferents open tabs by pressing "1","2","3" ...
You first need to modify "OpenWindows" variable by adding the number of windows you want and order them according to their position when you press ALT+TAB.

If you want to switch between 4 windows named 1,2,3,4 ordered when you press ALT+TAB as 3,2,1,4, you need to change OpenWindows to [3,2,1,4].
